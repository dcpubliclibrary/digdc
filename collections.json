Gonzales describes other Latino community organizations, including Ayuda and the Latin American Youth Center. Gonzales touches on his initial experiences when first immigrating to the United States from Ecuador, adapting to a new language, finding employment, and having trouble with social security. He is nevertheless satisfied with his experiences overall as well as his perspective about the United States.",

I lmow this to be true because I\nsurveyed the precinct in the scout car while listening to\nthe radio. At 2:00 P.M., Friday, April 5, 1968, I, was\nwith Governor Ronaid Regan of Ca1ifornia in the South East\nEnrichment Center, located 723-Sth Street, S.E., where he\nwas talking with Father Anderson and members of the neighbor\u00adhood.\nThe Governor finished his business and left the premise\nabout 3:00 P.M. Although there were large numbers of young\npeople on the street at this time there vas no disorder. It\nwas not until about 6:00 P.N., Friday, April 5, 1968, that\npolicemen in the Fifth Precinct observed a:ny real disorder.\nAt this time five men were observed smashing the front shO\\l\nwindow to a Mens\u2022 Haberdasher store at 611 Pa Ave S.E.

And also there was Benetta\nWashington, Junior. Benetta is the wife of Walter\nWashington, and Benetta is the daughter. They were all\nclassmates. And so there was a bit of interchange between\nthe families while he was Vice President. But before that, I\nhad been appointed, a Johnson appointee to the RLA, which is\nthe Redevelopment Land Agency, which was very active in those\ndays and we were actually responsible for the rejuvenation of\nthe waterfront and southwest Washington. And there are some\nstories there that I might touch upon and how a certain\nGeneral killed the Ponte Vecchio, but that is still another\nstory.\nQ: We'll come back to it.\nA: Yeah. I mean, it is an interesting story. I hope that\nname flashes to my.

Frazier also mentions Fide's House, which she describes as a place where people in the community could go for food and clothing. She remembers Shaw as a close knit community where everybody knew each other. Her telling of the riots begins with hearing that Martin Luther King Jr. had been assassinated. She describes how much of the neighborhood was destroyed and states that it remained in that state for a number of years. Frazier also discusses Fides House, a community center that offered services to the Shaw neighborhood.",

Like Dorothy Dandridge and, let\u2019s see who else. Ella Fitzgerald (more interview stuff not pertinent to Shaw, etc.)\nI met Nat King Cole, and I met Muhammad Ali, and um. I knew a couple of, her name was Lois Alexander. She was one of the original designers that lived here and went to New York. She had a fashion museum in New York. And I knew Lois. She did Jacqueline Kennedy\u2019s wedding gown. In fact I worked as an intern for her when I was going to school. And I just got up one morning. I found the address, I said, I\u2019m going to walk and find out where she was on Madison Avenue. That was in New York. But she was one of the gifted people I happened to come across.\nN: So would you say there was a pretty good fashion scene?\nB: It was a fashion scene, but it was cliquish. You didn\u2019t talk with the average person. You had a special clientele. Like LeDroit Park. Now if I had really come in\u2014(? 22:20) a few of mine, I\u2019ve gone to a black fashion designer\u2019s organization, and they had a clientele of all the people in LeDroit Park, and those kind of, the kind of people that really wore the outstanding couture-type things. And they did not sew for what we called the stores. So private clientele. And I did\u2014myself, my own business, I did dance costumes for Howard. And I\u2019ve done for the Duke Ellington dance department. So you come across\u2014as I said, when I came here I didn\u2019t know too many people. I met my friends through my association, through my work. And that\u2019s how I happen to know quite a few people. So it\u2019s been very interesting to say the least. I\u2019ve travel all the states except eight.\nN: Midwestern cut?\nB: North and South Dakota, Montana. Because I was working with Ebony magazine at the time and we did the fashion shows. It went, um, it closed in \u201908, because Ebony magazine, like every other magazine, was in trouble financially. So something had to go and unfortunately, that was it. Because back in the 60s, even during the riots, that was one place, one part of entertainment that each city down South and up North could go to. And actually see what Ms. Johnson and the magazine company had chosen as fashions for people to see. So it was very, very interesting, yeah.\nN: I\u2019m about out of questions. Well, I think that\u2019s about it\u2014\nEND OF RECORDING\n",

And it this stage of the game it\u2019s feast of famine everywhere you go, but it is definitely famine on the music end for me. So that\u2019s just not in the cards anymore. If I could get stable enough where I could get my own stuff out\u2026 I\u2019m not doing my own right now, or somebody\u2019s original stuff. I really don\u2019t have any interest in doing any covers, or the cummerbund circuit I call it, just straight-ahead and show tunes\u2014been there, done that.\nGotta do your own thing.\nYeah. I mean, I\u2019ve had several bands where all we did was original material in different forms. Had an avant garde group where we were doing some really crazy type stuff. I guess the closest we really got to getting out was a guy, Donnie Simpson, sent this producer by to check us out. I don\u2019t know whether he liked the stuff or not, but what he wanted to do was send us to Europe for a couple years to grind over there, get it going, then bring us back to the states. But there wasn\u2019t enough people in the band to just pull up. Pulling up and going to another state is one thing, but pulling up and going to Europe, to England for two years was another. So I guess that\u2019s about as close as I got. Oh! When I was nineteen I got an offer to play with Donald Cherry (?). I was sitting in at a jazz club just sitting in. Some members of his band were there and we exchanged numbers. About a week later I got a call and dude says, \u201cDon wants you to play with him.\u201d I said, \u201cHe ain\u2019t never met me.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, he\u2019s going on my word. Well this is the deal. If you want the gig, you gotta have a passport or you gotta get one quick, because we\u2019re leaving for France next week.\u201d So I was like\u2026 I was young, I didn\u2019t even know who Don Cherry was at the time. I was just a young dude that had chops and didn\u2019t know what to do with them, just flailing all over the place. I guess they could\u2019ve channeled it. I was working for a band, a road band, at the time and I couldn\u2019t just leave them, because we were just back in for a few weeks and we was getting ready to go back out, and I wouldn\u2019t have did that. But anyway, fellas, it\u2019s been a pleasure.\nLikewise, thank you very much. ",

New York Avenue all the way down to Constitution Avenue. The National Guards were down there, and nobody was able to get down into that area. But from New York Avenue all the way up, up to, I don\u2019t know, Silver Spring I guess. There was, you know. Because once again, 7th Street, there were all these little small stores that was owned by mostly Jewish people, or either Caucasians that were renting them out. But some people, unfortunately, burned up their own homes. Some of the homes were burnt out because they were that angry. They were just burning up stuff.\nAnd H Street. H Street was burnt up, too. It\u2019s taken all this time for the city to regroup. To be what it is today. But there\u2019s some more stories in between there, between the rioting and how it\u2019s gotten to where it is now.\nN: Well how would you say the neighborhood changed immediately afterwards?\nJ: It didn\u2019t change immediately afterwards. Barry, Marion Barry was the mayor. He was one of those mayors, he believed in helping the youth and the seniors. He was a grassroot mayor. Very arrogant young man. And there were a lot of white people that did not like that arrogancy. You know, a black man acting the way that he did, it was just unheard of. You didn\u2019t do it.\nSo, Barry, he had his own personal problems, you know. But it had nothing\u2014it reflected in his politics as well. He was\u2014I think Barry\u2019s mistake was that he hired too many of his personal friends. And that was part of his downfall. But he had been a good mayor to helping people who had never really had that hand up. And of course when they put him in office a second time, the city suffered. You want Barry again, you get no money. And that\u2019s what happened. So a lot of the renovations that could have been taken on during that time, it just didn\u2019t happen. It wasn\u2019t until Anthony Williams\u2014and I have my own spin on that. But it wasn\u2019t until Anthony Williams came into office that things got to change.\nN: When was this?\nJ: That was after Sharon Pratt Kelly. Uh, she, Sharon didn\u2019t do a whole heck of a lot, I didn\u2019t feel, for the city as, in renovating to get rid of some of the stuff that had burned up. I do believe that Alice Rivlin, along with\u2014they turned everything over to the city, and there was control over the dollars that was being spent in the city, along with Anthony Williams. It wasn\u2019t until then that things started to change, and Anthony Williams helped that a lot. So the city was able to get the money, and things started to change. When I first bought my house in \u201989, there was drugs, still, on either corner.\nN: And where is this, I\u2019m sorry?\nJ: I live on 8th Street, between P and Q. And there was still, the neighborhood was still infested with drugs. Because along the whole 7th Street corridor there were, there was still, well, there was a low-income housing development there that was owned by one of the churches, and H.R. Crawford\u2014another politician that was a turn[coat?]\u2014but anyway. The Seventh Street corridor was never the same after the riots.

So you could join in and not feel like you were interrogated by anybody. And the big, so-called big folks downtown kind of left us alone. It was like Harlem in New York, where U Street, I\u2019d say Rhode Island Avenue, but U Street really drew the line up. It was always open to anybody. But the people, I felt, were close-knit. There were always some rabble-rousers around. But for the most part, they blended in. They didn\u2019t make themselves known as radicals like they do now.\nN: (kind of cut off; asking how the neighborhood has changed)\nB: The neighborhood has changed because a lot of the, what I call the beautiful brownstone homes, have been pushed out I guess because they were owned by families. And I guess either the original owners have either passed on and their kids neglected to pay the taxes or didn\u2019t want to continue and they opt for more modern type of residences. I don\u2019t like what I see in this area, all these apartment houses they\u2019re just popping up because the O Street Market would be\u2014the original O Street Market would be a place you could hang out.

We couldn\u2019t cook in our campus rooms, but you could go there and get food that you wanted (? 13:12) there.\nN: How did you feel when you heard about the riots?\nB: I was very disturbed but I understood, because I knew the people were very frustrated. Like now with the economy, it was a jobs thing, you know. And all the businesses that were on Georgia and 7th were viable businesses, family businesses and so forth. And they were able to hire a certain number of people. But when the riots came in, it was like\u2014it was like an implosion. And they were doing things to hurt themselves, rather than go past U Street. Now had they gone downtown to F Street and some of the other companies, that never would have occurred. They would have brought the militia in and scorched it to start with. But I don\u2019t think they did as much as they could have to bring the peace in a peaceful manner. Because too much\u2014because after the riots, 14th Street did not look like the 14th Street that I knew. And it was, and it was very unsettling to me. Because it was such a beautiful place at that time. The Tivoli Theatre, and on Columbia Road and 14th Street used to be the Hot Shoppe. That was the one place you could go on Sundays and have Sunday dinner. That was one of the places everybody went, one of the restaurants over there. And there were a lot of unique stores and restaurants just like that, in that particular area.\nN: Did you have a chance to visit after the riots?\nB: After the riots? Yeah, I came, um, I came down to visit family. And we kind of drove through there. And I was amazed at how many places were boarded up. Just disappeared. There were mom and pop shops and so forth, and an influx of people were beginning to move in, the Asians and the Spanish and so forth. So it started being a melting pot. But it was still workable. But the original houses, the beautiful houses were no longer there.\nN: Did you have any friends or family in the area that were affected?\nB: No, most of my family that lived, they lived up Georgia but near Irving, and further that way toward Walter Reed. But no one\u2014none of my family lived directly in the Shaw area.\nN: Do you feel like things have changed since between the Riots and say, now, seeing the neighborhood as it is?\nB: Yeah, the neighborhood has changed, and I think a lot of people have been out-priced.

And that\u2019s what it was called for many years, because there are many schools around this country that were named after Paul Lawrence Dunbar, the poet. But this was the one that was specifically, it wasn\u2019t a hand-me-down school, it was created for people of color and their children. It used to be called the old M Street high school, and then it was officially named for him.\nSo it was a privilege specific--\n...specific. White people had never been to that school. White people never taught there. In other words, we didn\u2019t inherit this school. It was built for us.\nAs opposed to Shaw, for example?\nExactly, and Cardozo where it is physically now, up the hill there. That was Central High School for white people. And only after so much of the white population moved out of the city that it wasn\u2019t economically feasible to continue to try to have a school there. Then they moved. This apartment building that\u2019s right next door -- that\u2019s where they old Cardozo High School used to be. And it was much smaller, so the kids that graduated from Shaw would feed right into that school.\nThis is what we call the Asbury Building?\nYes, it is Shaw. In my head it will always be Shaw. I\u2019m glad that it\u2019s doing something for the senior citizens, but it\u2019s Shaw Junior High.\nThe Shaw school was originally going to be one of the focuses of the project, but not enough people have been either involved with it or aware enough of it. That\u2019ll be another project.\nYeah, I was telling her this morning that I just lost a friend who was a graduate of Shaw in, what\u2019d I tell you? Forty three. She just died like a week ago. And she knew so much. I do have another one, I may be able to funnel her to you, because they were in the same class when they came out of Shaw. The one who passed away? Her name was Lucy Bankett. They finally moved her out of her house at 104 U Street NE, and that was really the beginning of her decline. We don\u2019t really do well with transition as we age. If I\u2019m seventy-five, she was eighty-five, eighty-six. When she could no longer go up and down the steps, her neices and nephews insisted on putting her into one of these facilities, what do you call it? Assisted living. And something goes on in your head and your mind when you begin to feel that the end is imminent and you just don\u2019t survive. The one I\u2019m gonna funnel to you, I\u2019m gonna really have to really go through explaining this to her. She\u2019s in really good shape, and her memory is still good. Her name is Letty Bankett Stewart. They sat beside each other in junior high school. Everything was done in decency and order, they used to call it, but it was in alphabetical order when we were in school. You always knew where your place in line was because everything was done alphabetically.\nDid you want to talk at all about the riots?\nMy experience with the riots was. How can I describe it? I was still living on Irving Street. I had been through the marriage, the travel, the divorce, the remarriage, all that. I was now working in the census bureau which is in Suitland, Maryland, and I was taking a class at Agriculture Department in the evening. As we were leaving the class I was riding up 14th Street with the radio on and Nighthawk Terry (sp?) announced that Martin Luther King had been shot and I thought I was going to have a stroke. I mean I was just devastated, just, you know. You didn\u2019t know that he was dead, you prayed that he wasn\u2019t dead, but you just knew everything that he\u2019d worked so hard for, everything he had planned and prayed for was just gone forever. All you could think about was his wife and those children. What a horrible horrible thing to happen. So I just kept driving and driving and when I got to Irving Street I turned and I went home, but I had to just sit in the car until I could collect myself and go in. My grandfather was still living then, and he met me at the door, and we just hugged and we just cried and we tried to explain to my oldest children what was going on because my little ",

                "transc": "they just didn\u2019t make their skills available to you. But most others did. Most others. I would go as high as ninety-five percent, because the ones that were jackasses, I barely remember their names. I know who they are, I can go to my yearbook and point out this hussy and that one. But there may have been four teachers out of a hundred and fifty, who did not speak to miss McCall. And it made you feel so special because, before then, you were just another little kid. But once you got in -- you had to take these tests to get in -- and once you got in, you were a force to be reckoned with. Well it was like, I guess they called them IQ tests back then. And if your score was under a hundred, you weren\u2019t going in that block. My score was a hundred and forty when I was in eighth grade. So my great-grandmother had nothing to fear except the people not accepting whether she was a professional or not. Now she taught school in Mississippi, and you know where they stand on the chart of education in the world. So she was literally in the one-room schoolhouse teaching six different grades. But she taught me to read at home, so when I got to Monroe, in kindergarten, they put me in the second grade the next year. I graduated from elementary school at ten, from junior high school at thirteen, from Dunbar at sixteen. Because there was no more that I could get there. But it also told me to share what you have. When I was at kindergarten age I was reading to the students in the second grade. I was being taught in the sixth grade by the sister of Brigadeer Benjamin O. Davis, the first black man ever to be a Brigadeer General. I didn\u2019t know what it meant, and I thought she was a white woman, because she looked like a white woman. She had long, straight hair. We called her George Washington behind her back because she wore it in that little bun. But we were proud for her, because we say pictures of her brother on the wall, you know. We knew that the military was a high part of life. We knew about the war because the war was going on then. And we would line up in her room to buy the stamps. We bought stamps every week, and when you got to eighteen dollars and seventy-five cents you got a twenty-five dollar war bond. That was a big deal. That was our contribution to the war effort. This is right after president Roosevelt died. You know he didn\u2019t die here. He died in Warm Springs, Georgia. And my grandmother took me down to the Union Station to wait for his body to be brought back home. And my grandmother cried. I thought he was a relative.\nThat was Franklin?\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt, the only president to serve four times. The only person to be elected four times. He did not live to serve the fourth term. That\u2019s when Truman came in. But I thought he was a relative because I heard about him at the table every night. He spoke on the radio every Saturday morning. And we didn\u2019t have television, so I didn\u2019t know he wasn\u2019t a relative. She cried like my grandfather died when Martin Luther King died. So I just assumed another family member had passed away. And now Harry Truman was the last president to be able to walk down the street, free. He didn\u2019t allow the Secret Service to infringe on him. And he didn\u2019t allow anybody to call his daughter ugly or say that she couldn\u2019t sing. And she couldn\u2019t sing. He was a typical father. He loved his daughter, Margaret. I don\u2019t know whether she\u2019s still alive or not, but he was determined she was going to have a musical career. She played wonderful piano, but singing was not her forte.\nIt\u2019s true. Well, what about entertainment? You said that you\u2019ve lived a very different--\nA very sheltered life... [skipped school] from Dunbar. God I\u2019m ashamed. My grandmother, if she wasn\u2019t dead, she would get up. I too took an afternoon off from Dunbar. My reason was, who was that down there that I thought was worth the whipping that I got when I got home? Because everyone knew everything about everybody. So, even though I came back up my same route, back around the reservoir, blablabla, when I got to Hobart place, my grandmother met me. \u201cAnd where have you been this afternoon?\u201d I been to school. \u201cHow long? How long did you stay at school today?\u201d Well you can\u2019t lie, you cannot just lie, because they can just read you like a book, okay. My grandmother had three switches that she had uniquely braided in a pattern that would leave [welts] on me for days. Girls didn\u2019t wear pants then. I had to undress. My grandmother, if I was about fourteen, she was like sixty-five when I was born, so she was well into her eighties. My grandmother whipped me for three blocks, just whipped me and just walked with me, and I tried to move ahead of her, she would grab the back of my dress, and she just whipped me and just talked to me, and the talking was worse ",

They were showing their rage, their anger, because of what had happened. Martin Luther King had been killed. At 14th and U, you had Stokely Carmichael, who was trying to quiet them. There was Rap Brown. There were a lot of people in that corridor who were trying to quiet\u2014Petey Green. They were trying to put a cap on it. But there were a lot of people who were just furious about what had happened. They had taken our favorite child, you know? Martin Luther King had been killed. One of our leaders, which we didn\u2019t have whole lot of leaders out there. It just seemed as though all of people who stood out, seems like they were, you know, they made martyrs out of them, okay? And that evening, let\u2019s see. MyerEmco was a big music warehouse on Sherman Avenue. I really chuckled to see people coming out of there with speakers that were as big as that glass. I said, where on Earth are they going to take this? What are they going to do with this? People were running out of grocery stores with half a cow on their back. So it was a lot of ridiculous sort of things that was happening. There were some people who were running out with cases of liquor. Cigarettes, and things like that. So there were people who made money off of some of the stuff that they had looted.\nI had to go over to Southeast, because my cousin and I were staying\u2014Northeast, rather. We were staying off of Benning Road at that time. My cousin and I were living together. And I went over there, and there was rioting over there. There was no store that was owned by anybody who was white or either Jewish that was intact. Those people who had stores that were black-owned, they would put up the sign, \u2018Black Owned,\u2019 so that they would not receive that kind of retaliation. We waited until, like, 12 midnight, and we snuck out [of] the city. Because we went to Newark. Because they had put, uh, what is it called. I can\u2019t think of the work.\nC: National Guard.\nJ: Well the National Guard were here, but they also had, um, when they stop everything, when they won\u2019t allow you to do anything.\nN: Curfew?\nJ: Curfew. Thank you, thank you. Okay. They had put a curfew out, and people were not able to roam around. So we waited until 12 midnight and we were able to move out of the city, and we went to Newark. And in Newark they were also rioting. So it wasn\u2019t\u2014it was every metropolitan city that we know today that had heard about Martin Luther King\u2019s death. Black people, they were just in arms, alarmed at the whole thing. They were taking it out on whomever, whatever.\nThere were still Caucasians in the mix that were not treated\u2014it all depends on how they presented themselves. Whether or not they were attacked or, whatever. But it was mostly property that was really damaged very badly during that period of time.\nN: Interesting. How did you first hear about the riots? Was it on the news, or word of mouth?\nJ: I was at work, at 18th and I streets. And some of the engineers came in and said, they\u2019re rioting over ",
